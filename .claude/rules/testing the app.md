Testing

- Write unit tests using Jest and React Native Testing Library.
- Implement integration tests for critical user flows using Detox. Implement Detox only for end-to-end testing of key user flows such as login, registration, and complex UI interactions. Prioritize testing critical paths for the best ROI.
- Use Expo's testing tools for running tests in different environments.
- Consider snapshot testing for components to ensure UI consistency.
- Aim for a test coverage of at least 80% of your codebase, focusing on critical paths and user-facing components.
